# Analysis of a Smart Technical Question

## Introduction

We often come across questions related to code on forums and platforms like Stack Overflow. Not all questions are created equal; some are much more effective at eliciting useful and targeted help than others. This document aims to dissect why a particular question, which deals with manipulating Google Sheet data using Google Apps Script, is effective and can be classified as a 'smart question'.

## Specificity and Context

The question is highly specific, outlining what has been done, where the person is stuck, and what the end goal is. This makes it very clear for anyone trying to assist, offering them immediate understanding of the problem space.

---

## Self-Troubleshooting

Before posting, the asker has attempted to solve the issue themselves. They even pinpoint the TypeError they've encountered, signifying an understanding of the issue at hand. This shows a proactive approach, making it easier for helpers to step in with targeted suggestions.

---

## Detailed Information

The question comes with both the code and a sample dataset. This completeness allows for a full understanding of the situation, saving time and back-and-forths for everyone involved. Code is also well-formatted, which increases readability and helps potential helpers to identify issues more quickly.

---

## Openness to Learning

The asker is upfront about the areas they don't understand and is open to learning. This encourages potential helpers to not only provide a solution but also to educate the asker about the concepts involved.

---

## Inclusion of Error Message

Including the exact error message helps potential helpers diagnose the issue quickly. This often speeds up the troubleshooting process and makes it easier for those answering to provide immediate and relevant guidance.
