## Integrating AI into Software Engineering Education

I was shocked when we were allowed to use AI in our assignments and homework. Many professors are so against the use of AI tools and I understand why, but Professor Moore understands that the learning is our responsibility. If we use AI and it inhibits our learning, thats on the students. If we use AI and it helps us learn and progress, better to us. I think more professors should research how AI can help students learn efiiciently.

## Personal Experience with AI

In ICS 314, my experience with AI tools was diverse and insightful:

- **Experience WODs:** I didn't need AI as much on the homework WODs. The tutorial videos that came along with them were more than enough to unstump me when I got stuck. AI was useful when I had a problem that wasn't covered in the video. Such as setting up an environment, updating Node.js and more.
  
- **In-class Practice WODs:** AI was crucial in fixing errors and enhancing understanding. It explained why certain errors occurred, which was invaluable for learning.
  
- **In-class WODs:** AI acted as a co-pilot, speeding up project setups and debugging. It provided templates and detailed explanations, enhancing my learning experience. On the first couple of WODs I tried doing the problems as much as I could and remember what I learned, but as many other students come to realize that it's extremely difficult for the average college student to perform well in one class when you're dealing with 4 others, especially when those classes have no interest to you. AI helped me keep up my grade and to help me learn to solve problems, even though it would be better to sit down for hours to study.
  
- **Essays:** Writing is difficult. And if I'm being honest it's a bummer that colleges require you to taking so much writing courses that don't even apply to your major. Most of the time I am able to summarize my thoughts into 1 simple paragraph, but when you have to write 5 pages about a topic thats not apart of your everyday life, thats where you fall short. AI has helped me to expand my thoughts and to give me more ammo when it comes to writing.
  
- **Final Project:** AI is a big help is the final project. The final project where we have to build out our own website ideas is awesome but a lot harder than the WODs. The WODs were challenging, but they always had a solution and instructions you could follow. With the final project, you actually have to problem things you haven't encountered before. AI plays the role of a TA. When the teacher is unavailable, you go to the TA for some help. They  might not always be right but they can help.
  
- **Learning a Concept / Tutorial:** Initially, I relied heavily on AI, but as my understanding improved, I gradually started relying more on my skills.
  
- **Answering Questions in Class or Discord:** AI provided accurate answers but sometimes lacked the specific context, making it less effective for in-depth understanding.
  
- **Asking or Answering Smart-Questions:** While AI could give correct answers, it lacked the depth and insight of human interaction.
  
- **Coding Examples:** AI was a valuable resource, providing practical examples and explanations for specific functions.
  
- **Explaining Code:** AI excelled in making complex code understandable, akin to translating a foreign language.
  
- **Writing Code:** AI was a helpful guide, suggesting different approaches and helping me think through problems.
  
- **Documenting Code:** AI streamlined the documentation process, making it more efficient and comprehensive.
  
- **Quality Assurance:** AI was useful for identifying issues but required caution, as some suggestions could be misleading.

## Impact on Learning and Skill Development

- **Enhanced Understanding:** AI tools made comprehending complex concepts easier.
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Improved, though reliance on AI was a concern.
- **Skill Development:** Balancing AI's assistance with personal skill growth was challenging.

## Comparative Analysis and Future Considerations

- **Traditional vs. AI-Enhanced Learning:** AI adds engagement but also presents challenges in dependency and skill retention.
- **Future Role of AI:** Balancing AI's potential with the need for fundamental skills is key for the future of software engineering education.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on my use of AI in ICS 314, the experience highlights AI's potential as a powerful educational tool. It's crucial to use AI to augment learning while preserving the essential skills and critical thinking processes in software engineering. Finding the right balance will be pivotal in leveraging AI's capabilities in future educational contexts.
