# The Two Sides of ESLint: Annoying but Helpful

## What is ESLint?

ESLint is a static code analysis tool that identifies problematic patterns in JavaScript code. It integrates with various editors, including IntelliJ, providing real-time feedback to developers. ESLint ensures that your code follows best practices and maintains a consistent style.

---

## Why It Initially Feels Tedious

When you first integrate ESLint with IntelliJ, it can be rather irksome. The tool highlights code that doesn't meet set standards, requiring changes even for minor deviations. It's a bit like having an overzealous grammar teacher peering over your shoulder.

---

## The Green Checkmark: A Mixed Blessing

Chasing the elusive green checkmark—that sign that your code is ESLint-compliant—can feel tedious. However, once you have it, it does offer a sense of accomplishment. More importantly, it implies that your code is more maintainable, readable, and in line with best practices.

---

## How It Actually Helps

The more you use ESLint, the more you realize that the green checkmark isn't just a pretty symbol. It signifies code that's easier to debug, read, and maintain. ESLint prompts you to write better JavaScript code, employing practices that you might not have known before. So, it's not just about adhering to rules; it's about learning and growth.

## A Tool for Learning a Language

While ESLint is primarily used for maintaining code quality, its benefits as a learning tool can't be ignored. It enforces best practices that you might not be aware of as a beginner. So, in a way, ESLint educates you, making it easier to write better code in the future.

## Some Final Thoughts

It’s tempting to consider coding standards and tools like ESLint as burdensome chores. But it's more constructive to view them as opportunities for improvement and learning. While ESLint can be tedious, it's also immensely beneficial. So, for anyone coding in JavaScript, ESLint is worth the initial hassle for the longer-term gains.
