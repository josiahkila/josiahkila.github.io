Some people view coding standards as minor details, like how many spaces should be used for indentation or where to place a closing curly brace. In contrast, I think coding standards offer a lot more. They can improve the quality of your code and can even serve as a learning tool for new programming languages.

I started using ESLint in conjunction with IntelliJ recently. At first, I found it a bit tedious. My code was often marked with red lines, pointing out areas that didn't meet certain standards. The pursuit of a green checkmark, indicating my code was up to par, initially seemed like an extra chore. But after spending more time with it, I recognized its value. ESLint acts as a helpful, if sometimes annoying, guide. It encourages good coding habits, nudging you towards best practices. It might be irritating when you're in a hurry, but in the long run, it makes your code easier to read and maintain.

The tool serves as a kind of code review, but one that's automated and immediate. For example, ESLint will encourage the use of 'let' and 'const' over 'var,' which helps with understanding variable scope in JavaScript. It's these little things that contribute to a better grasp of the language and cleaner code. Is using ESLint cumbersome? Initially, yes. But is it beneficial? Definitely. It might take a little getting used to, but the tool makes you more disciplined as a developer. As you correct issues, you internalize best practices, which pays off in the long term.

In summary, while the specifics of coding standards may seem minor, they serve a significant role in producing quality code. They can also be instructive, teaching you better ways to use a language. ESLint, despite its initial annoyance, is a useful tool for this. It's a reminder to keep good habits, helping you to become a better developer overall.
