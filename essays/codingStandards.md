A lot of people think coding standards are just small rules about how to format your code. They focus on things like how many spaces to use or where to put brackets. I think there's a lot more to it. In my view, if you want to make your code better, using coding standards is the way to go.

I recently started using a tool called ESLint in my coding editor, IntelliJ. At first, it felt a bit annoying. ESLint flags even tiny issues in your code and won't give you a green checkmark until you fix them. But after using it for a week, I started to see the value.

Fixing the small issues ESLint pointed out made my code look cleaner. It was easier to read and understand. Plus, as I worked on fixing these issues, I began to notice other important details about the language I was using. This helped me learn faster.

Good coding standards can actually stop bugs before they happen. They also make it easier for everyone on a team to understand the code. This means less time figuring out what someone else's code does and more time solving the actual problem.

The ESLint tool helps a lot with this. It checks my code as I write it. Sure, it can be a bit annoying to get flagged for small stuff, but fixing these issues helps me learn better coding practices. It's like a mini-lesson in how to code better, right as I'm coding.

Some people think strict rules limit creativity. I don't agree. Having a clean, well-organized set of code can actually make it easier to be creative. It's like having a clean desk. You can think better when you're not distracted by clutter.

So, to sum it up, coding standards are about more than just making your code look good. They help you write better code, work better in a team, and learn the language faster. My experience with ESLint and IntelliJ has been pretty good, turning something that seemed annoying into a helpful learning tool.
