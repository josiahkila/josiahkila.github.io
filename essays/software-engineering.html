<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>While the primary focus of the course was on web application development, it is crucial to recognize that the skills and knowledge gained transcend this specific domain. In my case, before the semester started I have alrady been trying to been a website for an intership I am apart of. This class has taught me how to build a website off of a template, build components and pages, and deploy it to a live server. This class was probably my favorite because it gives me direction into what sector of Computer Science I was to venture down. Some other topics that I’ve learned in this course are Agile Project Management, specifically Issue Driven Project Management, and Functional Programming. These concepts extend beyond web development and can be applied to various project contexts.</p>

<h2 id="agile-project-management-and-issue-driven-project-management">Agile Project Management and Issue Driven Project Management</h2>

<p>Agile Project Management is a software development methodology that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. It breaks down the project into small, manageable increments called sprints, allowing for quick adaptations to changing requirements. Issue Driven Project Management, a style of Agile, centers around the management of individual issues or tasks as the primary unit of work.</p>

<p>Agile Project Management, including Issue Driven Project Management, is not limited to web application development. Its principles can be applied to virtually any project involving software or even non-software projects. The core ideas include continuous communication among team members, customer collaboration, and responding to change. For example, in a non-software project, such as planning a marketing campaign, an Agile approach can facilitate the adjustment of strategies based on evolving market trends and consumer feedback. Agile methodologies promote adaptability and customer-centricity, making them invaluable in various contexts.</p>

<h2 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h2>

<p>Functional Programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, avoiding changing state and mutable data. This approach enhances code reliability, maintainability, and testability. While functional programming is often associated with web development, it extends its benefits beyond this domain.</p>

<p>In non-web development projects, such as data analysis or scientific simulations, Functional Programming can help create more robust and bug-free code. The focus on immutability and pure functions ensures that the code’s behavior remains predictable, even in complex scenarios. Functional Programming principles can be employed to optimize algorithms, improve data processing pipelines, and enhance the reliability of scientific models.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This course has equipped me with valuable software engineering concepts that extend far beyond web application development. Agile Project Management, specifically Issue Driven Project Management, emphasizes flexibility and adaptability, making it applicable to a wide range of projects. Functional Programming principles promote code reliability and can enhance the quality of software in various domains.</p>

<p>By embracing these fundamental software engineering concepts, I am better prepared to tackle future projects, whether they involve web applications, data analysis, scientific research, or other domains. These skills and knowledge have broadened my perspective on software engineering, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, code quality, and user-centric development in any project context.</p>
